      <h2>Summary: </h2>

      <p>I have successfully passed the HTML Academy course, where I obtained the basic skills. After       that,     I     attended in the following projects “vvikota.github.io”.

           I continue my study on JS by constant examining the books with Internet resources. I have solved the     puzzles        on Codewars, and continue to solve. My goal is to become a strong front-end developer.     I like to learn the        new things every day. I want to develop in the chosen direction. I had the     interest to technical science        since my childhood. My foreign language level is under develop.     Now I attend the Duolingo course. The next        step is to sign up for English course.
